= Config Server sample

*Cook* is an example application demonstrating the use of Config Server for Pivotal Cloud Foundry. (For information on the Config Server product, please https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/config-server/[see the documentation].)

== Building and Deploying

. If using Maven, run:
+
....
$ mvn package
....
+
If using Gradle, run `./gradlew build` (OS X, Linux) or `gradlew.bat build` (Windows).
+
....
$ ./gradlew build
....

. Run the deployment script (link:scripts/deploy.sh[`scripts/deploy.sh`] on Linux or OS X, link:scripts/deploy.bat[`scripts/deploy.bat`] on Windows), giving it the path to the application archive. (This will be something like `target/cook-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` if you used Maven or `build/libs/cook-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` if you used Gradle.)
+
....
$ ./scripts/deploy.sh target/cook-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
....
+
The script will create a Config Server service instance, push the application, and bind the Config Server service instance to the application.

. When the script has finished, set the `TRUST_CERTS` environment variable to the API endpoint of your Elastic Runtime instance (as in `api.example.com`), then run `cf restage cook` to restage the application so that that change will take effect. Setting `TRUST_CERTS` causes Spring Cloud Services to add the the SSL certificate at the specfied API endpoint to the JVM's truststore, so that the client application can communicate with a Config Server service instance even if your Elastic Runtime instance is using a self-signed SSL certificate (see the https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/config-server/writing-client-applications.html#self-signed-ssl-certificate[Config Server documentation]).
+
....
$ cf set-env cook TRUST_CERTS api.wise.com
Setting env variable 'TRUST_CERTS' to 'api.wise.com' for app cook in org myorg / space development as user...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
$ cf restage cook
....
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the Config Server client dependency will cause all application endpoints to be secured by HTTP Basic authentication. For more information or if you wish to disable this, https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/config-server/writing-client-applications.html#disable-http-basic-auth[see the documentation]. (HTTP Basic authentication is disabled in this sample application.)

== Trying It Out

. Visit `[ROUTE]/restaurant`, where `[ROUTE]` is the route bound to the application. The &#8220;special&#8221; of the day will be taken from the configuration repository and the value of `cook.special`.
